 I'm a graduate student majoring in Technology and Humanities at Illinois Institute of
 Technology. I am also an Architect with M. Arch degree from State University of New York at
 Buffalo (UB). At UB, I had the opportunity to mainly focus on social and behavioral aspects
 of my field which is an inseparable part of architecture but is usually neglected by
 architects. I also have a B.Sc degree in architectural engineering.

 I decided to continue my education in Technology and Humanities major after a critical
 question in my mind changed from "How can a design impact peoples' life" to "How people give
 meaning to and define a design". That is why in the Department of Architecture and Urban
 Planning at UB, I joined the inclusive design research group. I focused all my endeavors on
 studying the user behavior in design. I had the opportunity to research in topics such as
 “Having an optimal and dynamic environment for patients and their caregivers in healthcare
 centers” or “Enhancing durability and enjoyability of the public space by using behavior
 observations, interviews, surveys and archival information for data analysis”. I took as
 many courses as possible that provided a connection between Architecture and Humanities.

 My thesis with the title of “Cultural comparisons of public space, with a focus on the
 streetscape of Tehran” focused on enhancing social interaction among Iranian young adults in
 public spaces. I came up with an innovative crowdsourcing method in which information was
 collected from social media by asking users to participate in my work which received a lot
 of attention in my department and among my faculty. Despite having limited access to the
 target population and area under study, crowdsourcing by social media became the foundation
 of data gathering in my research. Furthermore, snowball sampling technique was used in order
 to make sure all the participants are young adults between the age of 18 to 26.
