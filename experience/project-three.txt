 I collected a few other skills through my industry experience where I gained practical
 skills to execute my ideas. I worked for a year as a 3D modeler in Mehrazan Consulting
 Company under the supervision of Behrooz Pakdaman, one of the best known architects in
 Tehran. I also worked as a design developer in Sazeh Felez Paydar and under the direct
 supervision of Dr. Mirghaderi, a Professor at Tehran University and the number one steel
 structural designer in Iran.
