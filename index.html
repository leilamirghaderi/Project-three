      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I'm a graduate student majoring in Technology and Humanities at Illinois Institute of
        Technology. I am also an Architect with M. Arch degree from State University of New York at
        Buffalo (UB). At UB, I had the opportunity to mainly focus on social and behavioral aspects
        of my field which is an inseparable part of architecture but is usually neglected by
        architects. I also have a B.Sc degree in architectural engineering <a

      <p id="read">For Switching</p>
      <p id="action">  I decided to continue my education in Technology and Humanities major after a critical
        question in my mind changed from "How can a design impact peoples' life" to "How people give
        meaning to and define a design". That is why in the Department of Architecture and Urban
        Planning at UB, I joined the inclusive design research group. I focused all my endeavors on
        studying the user behavior in design. I had the opportunity to research in topics such as
        “Having an optimal and dynamic environment for patients and their caregivers in healthcare
        centers” or “Enhancing durability and enjoyability of the public space by using behavior
        observations, interviews, surveys and archival information for data analysis”. I took as
        many courses as possible that provided a connection between Architecture and Humanities.
        My thesis with the title of “Cultural comparisons of public space, with a focus on the
        streetscape of Tehran” focused on enhancing social interaction among Iranian young adults in
        public spaces. I came up with an innovative crowdsourcing method in which information was
        collected from social media by asking users to participate in my work which received a lot
        of attention in my department and among my faculty. Despite having limited access to the
        target population and area under study, crowdsourcing by social media <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/gloryofvaliasr/?hl=en">(Instagram)</a> became the foundation
        of data gathering in my research. Furthermore, snowball sampling technique was used in order
        to make sure all the participants are young adults between the age of 18 to 26.
