  My ultimate goal is to get my PhD in Technology and Humanities. I want to be able to do
  more research about the ways people give meaning to design by using social media. Hopefully
  I can get a job in a Tech company with focus on social interaction. My goal of developing
  this page is first to introduce myself and research interests to the world and also make it
  more dynamic and interactive for gathering information from users and their experiences.
